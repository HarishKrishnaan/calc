/*
add() - notes to implement add function as a template for all other normal operation functions

single digit operations without = present:

    if historyEl.textContent.includes("/", "(", ")")

        historyEl becomes answer + next operation and inputEl becomes answer

single digit operations with "+", "-", "×", "÷" and ("=") present (no cases where single digit ops with = exist without double digit ops)

    else if historyEl.textContent.includes("=", "/", "(", ")", "+", "-", "×", "÷","=")

        historyEl becomes answer + next operation and inputEl becomes answer

normal operations where there is no equals or single digit operations, switching occurs:

    else if historyEl.textContent.includes("+", "-", "×", "÷")

        left side of operation stays and the operation sign changes to whichever button is 	pressed, equals handles the output
	    once new number is input, creates answer onclick of + and makes historyEl = answer + " + " and inputEL = answer

normal operations where = exists with no single digit operations:
	
	else if historyEl.textContent.includes("+", "-", "×", "÷" && "=")
		
		left side of operation becomes answer and operation sign changes to whichever button is pressed
		

empty history where historyEl == "":

    else

        history becomes input + "operation"

equals() - notes to mainly update the equals function so that it knows how to parse historyEl even with "/", "(", ")" present, as to not result in NaN values

sqrt() - if 2 number op exists before sqrt is pressed, it deletes that part of the history and only considers most recent input

    if history == "" || historyEl.textContent.includes("/", "(", ")") 

        answer becomes sqrt of input, inputEl becomes answer, historyEl becomes input + operation

    else if historyEl.textContent.includes("=")

        history as sqrt(answer), and calculates input as sqrt(answer)

    else --equals() function has to know how to handle this case

        history becomes a(left side of operation) + operation + sqrt(inputEl) and input becomes sqrt(inputEl), input only becomes a + b when equals is pressed. 



Notes:
.includes() - counts white space
.indexOf() - DOES NOT count white space
