//Problem: pressing operator sign shouldn't continuously operate, just assign operator, 
//Solution 2: cases to identify:
//operations with equals that take the answer and continue operating:
    //if historyEl.textContent.includes("=", "/", "(", ")")
        //history becomes answer + next operation and input becomes answer
//operations
    //else if historyEl.textContent.includes("+", "-", "×", "÷")
        // left side of operation stays and the operation sign changes to whichever button is pressed, equals handles the output
//previous operation with equals:
    //else
        //history becomes
//Problem: switching between operations doesn't work, sets left side to "" and results in NaN error, 
//Solution: fix ending state of each function to aid in transitioning between functions
