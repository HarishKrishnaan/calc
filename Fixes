//Problem: pressing operator sign shouldn't continuously operate, just assign operator, 
//Solution 2: cases to identify:
//operations with equals that take the answer and continue operating:
    //if historyEl.textContent.includes("=", "/", "(", ")")
        //history becomes answer + next operation and input becomes answer
//normal operations where there is no equals, switching occurs:
    //else if historyEl.textContent.includes("+", "-", "×", "÷")
        // left side of operation stays and the operation sign changes to whichever button is pressed, equals handles the output
        //once new number is input, creates answer onclick of + and makes historyEl = answer + " + " and inputEL = answer
//empty history where historyEl == "":
    //else
        //history becomes input + "operation"
//Problem: switching between operations doesn't work, sets left side to "" and results in NaN error, 
//Solution: fix ending state of each function to aid in transitioning between functions
