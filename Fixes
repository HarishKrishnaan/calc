//Problem: pressing operator sign shouldn't continuously operate, just assign operator, 
//Solution 1: change to have to use = to repetitively operate instead of allowing continuous pressing of operation button.
//Solution 2: cases to identify:
//no text:
    //if historyEl = ""
//previous operation with equals:
    //if historyEl.textContent.includes("=")
//previous operation with equals:
    //else
//Problem: switching between operations doesn't work, sets left side to "" and results in NaN error, 
//Solution: fix ending state of each function to aid in transitioning between functions
